# Task Tracker

This is a template for a task tracking application. It is using Parcel for development, but can be run and deployed on a Node server as well using Express.

Development Process: 

Iterations: 

Further improvements / recommendations : 

When designing the mockup of this prototype, there were many features i intended on having on the site including: categories for users to browse through / ways for them to search and scroll efficiently on the page. However, when actually coding it, i came across a few issues including but not limited to unable to accurately access the right id for the variables of the objet. 

For future improvements, i would love to add more functionality to the code, this includes incorporating the different categories as drop downs for users to click and open so it isn't just a list over the whole page. 

Would love to have different filters, e.g. "show Vietnamese / Japanese restaurants and have a list of them. 

Lessons Learnt / Best practices: 
The first lesson learnt is definitely to have better time management and be patient when coding. Especially when the smallest little unintended changes / mistakes can cause the whole code to not function. E

However, aside from that, i had developed and enhanced my personal coding skills. Firstly, is using scss. Initially i began coding with css and i remembered learning about scss, when i began using it, i noticed that it would make the code a lot neater, easier and more efficient. It was like iterating through loops / if statements in python/java but for scss. That was very interesting. 

Working with forms and accessing the backend java server to obtain user input data. I would love to further learn about how i can access this data and certain categories more specifically in the future. 

Using buttons to show / hide information. I learnt how to use functions to create a button that will show / hide information when clicked. Following the week 3 tutorials, i also felt more confident in coding different functions and even for deleting items in the array. 

Alongside coding the backend, i learnt a lot more new techniques when coding the css/scss including adding background shadows, background radius, background inset creating depth and how to align things a lot better.
